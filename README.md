# React Portfolio

My portfolio, created in React, that showcases a range of my work

## Inspiration

This is a Bootcamp project, to develop my learning and understanding of creating React applications. 

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was deployment - it proved to be a fiddly process! It took some time to figure out how to get it all to deploy and display correctly. 

## Further development

This will be a work in progress, that I will keep improving and adding new features to as I become more proficient in React. Sections that respond according to specific subjects: Front End, Music Tech etc. This way I would be able to display a wide range of projects without cluttering the page.
